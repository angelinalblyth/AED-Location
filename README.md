# Weekend homework.

## Key learning to practise and/or revise:

 - Manipulating the DOM - selecting/creating/appending elements
 - Using event listeners to make our apps interactive
 - Making an HTTP request to retrieve some data and then using it

## Task:

Practise what we've done this week using JavaScript in the browser:

- Fetch information from an API.
- Display/Analyse the information in the browser using DOM manipulation/Charts/Maps/Canvas etc. Be creative!

GitHub user toddmotto maintains [a HUGE list of links to open APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) on many subjects. We _strongly_ recommend that you avoid APIs which require OAuth authentication. APIs which are listed as requiring an apiKey require a _little_ bit of extra work, but this should be documented by the API itself.

In particular we recommend:

  - REST countries: https://restcountries.eu/
  - Football Data: http://api.football-data.org/index - Make sure you sign up for a Free API key to use in your requests otherwise you may get CORS errors in Chrome.
  - OMDB - Film info: http://www.omdbapi.com/ - no key needed.
  - News API: https://newsapi.org/ - News stories from several different sources
  - Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI - fun gifs! Free key provided.
  - Open Weather Map: http://openweathermap.org/api - Free API key on sign up.
  - Harry Potter: http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/
  - MusixMatch: https://developer.musixmatch.com/ - get info on music charts, artists and their music, lyrics. Free API key when you sign up.
